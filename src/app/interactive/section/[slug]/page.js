      "Climate change is a global humanitarian crisis with worsening impacts. 2023 was the warmest year on record (WMO, 2023). More than 200 climate and weather-related disasters were recorded worldwide, affecting about 77 million people.",
      "The year saw unprecedented extreme events, such as the second longest-lived tropical cyclone on record, Freddy, in the South Indian Ocean; Cyclone Mocha, one of the heaviest cyclones ever in the Bay of Bengal, and Storm Daniel in Libya (WMO, 2023).",
      "The Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Centre is part of the World Weather Attribution studies which found that, amongst others, climate change increased the intensity of heavy rainfall in Libya during Daniel by up to 50 per cent, while intense heatwaves in 2023 in China, Europe and North America would have been extremely rare or impossible without climate change.",
      "Between 3.3â€“3.6 billion people live in contexts highly vulnerable to climate change. It is the world's poorest and most exposed people who suffer the most (IPCC 2023).",
      "In Africa, food and water systems rely heavily on rain-fed agriculture and pastoralism, which are extremely vulnerable to climate change. These challenges worsened the continent's existing and overlapping drivers of vulnerability such as poverty, and limited resources, leading to displacement, food insecurity and deaths.",
      "The Americas face high exposure to warming temperatures, sea level rise, coastal erosion and ocean acidification. The region was affected by a range of extreme events in 2023, including hurricanes and floods and dry seasons generating droughts affecting agriculture and industry production.",
      "In Asia Pacific, climate change is raising the risks of cyclones, and contributing to a rise in vector-borne diseases such as dengue fever and malaria. The region experienced severe flooding, droughts, and extreme weather events throughout 2024.",
      "The European region faced unprecedented heatwaves, wildfires, and flooding events that highlighted the urgent need for climate adaptation measures. Many countries reported record-breaking temperatures and extreme weather patterns.",
      "The Middle East and North Africa region experienced severe water scarcity, extreme heat, and dust storms that affected millions of people. Climate change exacerbated existing vulnerabilities and created new humanitarian challenges.",
      "Small Island Developing States faced existential threats from sea level rise, coastal erosion, and increased frequency of tropical cyclones. Many communities were forced to relocate due to climate impacts.",
      "Arctic regions experienced rapid ice melting, permafrost thaw, and ecosystem changes that affected indigenous communities and global climate patterns. The rate of change exceeded scientific projections.",
      "Mountain regions worldwide faced glacier retreat, changing precipitation patterns, and increased risk of natural disasters. These changes affected water resources for billions of people downstream.",
      "Coastal communities globally experienced increased flooding, storm surge damage, and saltwater intrusion into freshwater systems. Adaptation measures became critical for survival.",
      "Urban areas faced heat island effects, flooding, and air quality issues exacerbated by climate change. Cities became focal points for both vulnerability and innovation in climate response.",
      "Rural communities, particularly those dependent on agriculture, faced crop failures, livestock losses, and changing growing seasons. Traditional knowledge systems were challenged by unprecedented changes.",
      "The humanitarian sector recognized the need for anticipatory action, early warning systems, and climate-resilient programming. Innovation in humanitarian response became essential for effective assistance.",
      "International cooperation and climate finance became critical components of humanitarian response. The IFRC advocated for increased funding for climate adaptation and disaster risk reduction.",
      "Community-based approaches proved most effective in building resilience to climate impacts. Local knowledge and participation were essential for sustainable solutions.",
      "The intersection of climate change, conflict, and displacement created complex humanitarian crises requiring integrated responses. Multi-sectoral approaches became the norm rather than the exception.",
      "Technology and innovation played crucial roles in climate monitoring, early warning, and response coordination. Digital solutions enhanced the effectiveness of humanitarian interventions.",
      "Youth engagement and leadership became central to climate action and humanitarian response. Young people drove innovation and advocacy for climate justice and humanitarian principles.",
