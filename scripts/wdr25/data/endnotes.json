CyberPeace Institute. (2024) pp.5–6 defines harm as: “an impairment or disruption of an entity’s capacity or ability to function and exist as it otherwise would have in its usual context”. This definition identifies four levels of harm affecting individuals, organizations, societies and international peace and security. See also UN. High-Level Advisory Body on Artificial Intelligence.Governing AI for Humanity: Final Report. (2024) cited in Paris Peace Forum.Forging Global Cooperation on AI Risks: Cyber Policy as a Governance Blueprint. (2025). This highlights that a strong emphasis on risks and harms should be at the centre of AI governance “that focuses on who is at risk and accountable, and not just what is at risk”."
