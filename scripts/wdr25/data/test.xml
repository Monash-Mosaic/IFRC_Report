    <normal>The task now is to ensure that the necessary safeguards, engagement, proximity, trust
      and resilience are not left to chance or profit, but are deliberately harnessed to protect
      people and enable principled humanitarian action.<fig

    <normal>Trust is critical to the legitimacy, effectiveness and acceptance of humanitarian
      action. This was strongly emphasized at the 2019 International Conference of the Red Cross and
      Red Crescent Movement which recognized<regular-italic> </regular-italic>that trust in
      principled humanitarian action is indispensable to serving at-risk people and encouraged all
      members of the conference to act to preserve and develop this trust.<endnotes-ref>[^]</endnotes-ref>
      Crucially, trust in humanitarian action does not rest solely on humanitarian actors. It also
      depends on a conducive environment &#8211; one in which principled, effective and accountable
      action is actively supported. Such an environment is shaped by the legal, political and
      operational frameworks established by states and other actors. This includes respect for
      humanitarian principles, flexible and needs-based funding, protection of humanitarian access
      and clear delineation of roles and responsibilities of various actors. </normal>
