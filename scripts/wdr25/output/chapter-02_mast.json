This reflects what many describe as a post-trust world – one in which people are especially vulnerable to harmful information and deepening polarisation over what is considered true or false. Such polarisation increases the risk of social unrest, violence and even armed conflict. There is also a secondary level of manipulation in today’s “post-trust” world, where institutions themselves come under scrutiny and their legitimacy is increasingly contested. In some contexts, polarisation between opposing political, social or geopolitical dynamics has created conditions in which public authorities may challenge or overturn established processes or outcomes, despite the absence of clear evidence of interference or wrongdoing. This erosion of institutional credibility poses profound questions for public trust. In turn, as humanitarian actors mandated by public authorities, the National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies face heightened reputational risks if confidence in governance continues to deteriorate."

Instead of using facts to inform our beliefs, information – regardless of its truthfulness – is increasingly used to justify the beliefs already held by individuals and the groups they affiliate with.

Many communities had extremely limited access to health education and information (Royston et al, 2020). Information from social media platforms or state news outlets was often distrusted and many people did not understand the rationale behind public health measures. In several countries, governments issued contradictory advice and oversimplified or false beliefs took hold – for example, claims that COVID-19 was only dangerous to the elderly and clinically vulnerable or, in Zimbabwe, that “COVID-19 does not kill black people”. These narratives, compounded by vaccine related disinformation (such as sterility or microchip claims) and entrenched anti-vaccine beliefs, drove harmful behaviours including vaccine refusal and avoidance of life-saving health measures."

People often tend to adopt an absolute “belief that” stance, even on matters that would more appropriately warrant a more probabilistic “belief in” that acknowledges uncertainty and complexity.

In Peru, for instance, health workers were labelled as “white devils” and accused of bringing the virus into communities. These beliefs were not simply a result of misinformation – they reflected traditional conceptions of illness and were exacerbated by limited access to accurate, culturally relevant information. Often, public health messaging was shared in a single language and failed to reflect the communities’ own perspectives on health and healing.

As highlighted in Commission III discussions in 2019, states play a decisive role: their policies and practices can either foster trust and enable principled humanitarian action or hinder it. States also have a responsibility to support and facilitate the work of the National Society in their country, in their auxiliary role to public authorities.

The IFRC identified trust as one of the strongest predictors of a successful emergency response, making preparedness fundamentally dependent on cultivating trust within communities and societies. To support this, the IFRC developed the Community Trust Index – an evidence-based tool to measure and strengthen trust between National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies and the communities they serve. The index tracks changes in trust over time and identifies the factors that influence it across different contexts. By uncovering barriers to trust, it guides tailored activities that promote trust-based behaviours, improve community acceptance and enhance programme effectiveness. It also links trust to compliance, governance and inclusive, community-informed decision-making, reinforcing accountability and impact."

At times, accusations of silence or complicity are directed at components of the Movement, especially during armed conflicts. Failing to speak can leave an information vacuum that others may fill, eroding trust. Yet speaking out can be equally fraught, as statements may be perceived as “taking sides” – especially in limited, emotionally charged online comment sections.

To safeguard it, principled humanitarian actors must consistently advocate for the protection of a neutral and impartial humanitarian space, free from political influence.

The ability to protect and assist victims of armed conflicts, in accordance with the 1949 Geneva Conventions and their Additional Protocols, depends on strict adherence to the principles of humanity, impartiality, neutrality and independence.

Can humanitarian organisations trust each other to work in common cause? Slim argues that humanitarian organisations themselves have contributed to the trust deficit. Research by Grand Challenges Canada also makes this link, noting that a lack of transparent communication, conflicting mandates and failure to protect communities when needed can exacerbate distrust. These shortcomings not only erode public confidence but also create fertile ground for harmful information to thrive – further deepening scepticism and reluctance to trust humanitarian organisations."

The Governing Board initiated internal investigations and introduced interim governance measures to safeguard operational integrity. New management and Board members were appointed to steer the institution through a structured change process. Over time, URCS strengthened internal accountability mechanisms, improved financial oversight and introduced more rigorous leadership vetting procedures. The National Society also underwent an Organisational Capacity Assessment that resulted in the development of 11 recovery pillars guiding institutional rebuilding."

As Singer and Brooking noted: “On social media, everyone may be entitled to their own facts, but rarely do they form their own opinions. There’s someone else manufacturing the beliefs that go viral online.” In this environment, identifiability becomes a cornerstone of trust. Trust depends not just on what is said, but on who is saying it – whether an individual, an institution, a troll or an AI system. In particular, “It helps answer some of the questions that trust inspires us to ask: Is there a recognisable and persistent identity to the institutions and individuals behind the myriad websites one might visit?” Identifiability supports reputation, accountability and helps distinguish credible sources from malicious actors."

General-purpose AI can now produce and spread both accurate and false content – including synthetic media – at an unprecedented scale. This raises the risk that people may begin to distrust information altogether. This dynamic could undermine public debate (and in democracies, democratic processes). Malicious actors can exploit this ambiguity and distrust through the so-called liars dividend – dismissing real evidence as fake. However, societies may adapt over time, developing new norms and tools to evaluate credibility, much as they did with past technologies like image, video and audio editing. But until such norms take hold, uncertainty and distrust are likely to deepen."

It refers to the ability to cryptographically verify the origin, history and integrity of digital content. Initiatives, such as the Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity (C2PA), are developing cross-sector open technical standards to attach secure metadata to digital files. These standards can help determine whether an image was altered, who published it, and what tools were used – offering markers for authenticity and digital trust. However, provenance is not a silver bullet. It comes with its own risks, such as exposing sensitive information, enabling surveillance, increasing reliance on major platforms and proprietary tools, or reinforcing a trust gap between content that is verifiable and content that is not. This is why it is necessary to shape the provenance ecosystem – including standards, legislation and implementation – with a focus on privacy, equitable access, power dynamics and the protection of human rights."

Humanitarian organisations must also actively communicate who they are, what they do, their impact and why they act – making a clear, compelling case for principled humanitarian action and for the preservation of a neutral and impartial humanitarian space, free from political influence. Despite the barriers posed by polarised perceptions, principled humanitarian organisations can maintain – and even rebuild – trust and acceptance in the face of harmful information. A critical question going forward is whether trust and proximity at the community level can serve as a firewall against the spread or impact of harmful information.
